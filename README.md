Solar System

This is an interactive 3D Solar System Simulation built using Three.js. Explore the planets, moons, and stars with smooth animations and interactive zooming.


Features

Realistic Orbits – Planets and moons move dynamically around the Sun.

Interactive Zoom – Click on a planet or moon to focus on it.

Rotating Planets – Each planet spins on its axis.

Starfield Background – A realistic space environment with distant stars.

Smooth Animations – Everything moves naturally using requestAnimationFrame.

No installation required!


Code Overview

This project uses:

Three.js for 3D rendering.

PointLights & AmbientLights for realistic lighting.

Raycaster for selecting planets and moons.

Orbit Mechanics to simulate planetary motion.



Animations

Planets orbit the Sun dynamically.

Moons orbit their planets in real-time.

Camera smoothly moves toward selected planets or moons.

Stars twinkle in the background for immersion.



Interactions

Click on a Planet/Moon: Zooms in on it.

Click on Empty Space: Resets the view.

Resize Window: The scene adapts dynamically.



Customization

You can modify the simulation by adjusting:

Planet Sizes & Speeds

Colors & Textures

Camera Angles & Lighting


Feel free to tweak and experiment!


Future Enhancements

Add realistic planet textures

Implement accurate distances & scales

Introduce asteroid belt & more moons
